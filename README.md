# SourceGetterProject

This Java project extends the Frame class and implements the ActionListener interface to generate the HTML, CSS, and JS code for any website you provide the URL for. The bulk of the program resides in the actionPerformed method, which occurs upon the literal press of a button. Nested within a try-except statement, it takes the URL and pastes the source code of that website inside a giant textbox. Insightful for anyone who wants to investigate the code behind a website and wants to tinker with it.
